# Canvas AI

**Canvas** is a cross-platform desktop overlay to help organize your work / workflows and **data** into separate "contexts".  

Contexts are organized into a tree structure resembling a file-system hierarchy where every tree node represents a separate layer(linked to a bitmap index(es)) filtering down all unstructured information fighting for your attention on a standard(tm) desktop setup(emails, notifications, chat messages, growing number of random browser tabs and ad-hoc download-extract-test-forget endeavors).
