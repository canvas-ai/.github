**Canvas** is a cross-platform desktop overlay to help organize your work, workflows and **data** into separate "contexts".

Contexts are organized into a dynamic tree structure resembling a file-system hierarchy. Every tree node represents a separate layer(linked to one or more context bitmaps) filtering down all unstructured information fighting for your attention while working in a standard(tm) desktop environment(emails, notifications/chat and system messages, growing number of random browser tabs, unmanageable stack of windows and ad-hoc download-extract-test-forget endeavors to name a few).

## Couple of core principles to start with

- **You own your data**  
  You can run every part of the application stack wherever you want, with whatever data or compute backend you want
- **Offline first**  
  Iow - if a solar CME kicks this civilization back to the stone age(again?) and you happen to have a working power source, you can still browse all your metadata || cached data to check on your appointments, emails, tax returns and all the other stuff you no longer have to worry about (or browse cached content related to things you need to worry about)
